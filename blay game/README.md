YEAR: Spring 2024 - Ongoing
SUMMARY:
Here are a few code samples from my ongoing solo project Blay. I can't put the entire Unity repository here, but I have selected some of the 'highlights' or code that either showcases clean architecture and practices or do something interesting.
Board.cs - used to parse a puzzle string to create the board/puzzle in game space. 
LevelSelectMView.cs - custom made horizontal level scrolling menu to support custom features
CameraMovementController.cs - parses user input to move the camera around the focal point
