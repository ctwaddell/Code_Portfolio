SUMMARY:
A HLSL shader I wrote for one of my 3D animation classes. It is intended for use in Maya using the DirectX11 rendering plugin. It asks the user for a base color of black or white and then whether the mesh should be rendered with none, single, or double outlines. It does this by taking a vertex and moving it along its normal vector to 'expand' it into the shape of an outline.
